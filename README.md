## Simple API Structure in Flask

My goal is just have the boilerplate of adding a API functionality on my aplicattions already done. I can just pull and make the ajusts I need.

> OBS: Is a good practice run your applications inside a virtual enviroment.  

``` python
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
make install # on dir that holds Makefile
FLAsK_APP=simple_api/app flask run # told flask where is our app
